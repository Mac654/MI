Winter Internship Challenge at Mozok ,
React + Typescript  from Marjan Petrushevski

Description of challenge solution:

1. For the first 2 parts of the challenge by using react router dom and mui react component library, it was enough to handle the tasks.
2. For the third part, we needed to go through 2 fetch api's in order to play with the data and render it in the dom,pretty sweet!
-The way I go about this is divide and conquer! 
-First,we fetch data 1.Iterate through it by making fetch for data 2 with the added parameter and get the required data.
-Afterwards set the react state by adding the data you need to the object while maping through data 1.
3. And lastly, the bonus part. We added few lines of css and aos library for some smooth effect transtions on scroll,pretty cool right?

Now lets all get cozy and comfy next to the bonfire,
Its getting cold around here.
